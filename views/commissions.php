						<p>I have been doing commissions for seven years. I enjoy doing portraits of people and animals, still lives, landscapes and other objects. I have uploaded some example commissions I am fond of. Please contact me if you are interested - I am willing to meet with you if you'd like. Prices are negotiable and will vary based on time and medium.</p>
